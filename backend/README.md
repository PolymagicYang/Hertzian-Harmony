## Hertzian Harmony

### Implementaion Details
FastAPI for the backend
We could launch a simple file system in the path of the name of vml

### Database design
Request a bunch of phone numbers to compose a phone number pool, and create the relations between the phone numbers and the questions numbers (Phone Number 1 <=> question 1, etc), every time we create a new question we just need to combine the related entries: the phone number, questions, vxml files.

Because we don't need to consider the language when voting, we could use many open source text2speech apps to generate the corresponding results.
